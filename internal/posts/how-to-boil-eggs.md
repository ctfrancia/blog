## Ingredients
- Eggs
- Water
- Salt (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Place the eggs in a saucepan**:
   - Arrange the eggs in a single layer at the bottom of the saucepan.

2. **Add water**:
   - Fill the saucepan with enough cold water to cover the eggs by about an inch.

3. **Add salt (optional)**:
   - Adding a pinch of salt can help prevent the eggs from cracking and make them easier to peel.

4. **Heat the water**:
   - Place the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat and bring the water to a rolling boil.

5. **Boil the eggs**:
   - Once the water reaches a rolling boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and let the eggs simmer.
   - For soft-boiled eggs, cook for 4-6 minutes.
   - For medium-boiled eggs, cook for 7-9 minutes.
   - For hard-boiled eggs, cook for 10-12 minutes.

6. **Cool the eggs**:
   - Remove the eggs from the hot water and place them in a bowl of ice water.
   - Let them sit for about 5 minutes to stop the cooking process and make them easier to peel.

7. **Peel and enjoy**:
   - Gently tap the eggs on a hard surface to crack the shell, then peel off the shell.
   - Rinse the eggs under cold water to remove any remaining shell pieces.

## Tips
- Use older eggs for easier peeling.
- Store boiled eggs in the refrigerator if not eating immediately.

Enjoy your perfectly boiled eggs!
